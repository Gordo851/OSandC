Hey Guys, I've just set this up, will add the current .c and .h files I'm working on atm in just a sec.

Added the most current files I have. When you run them you'll see it's still giving errors for malloc and realloc.

Oh i am so sorry Gordo, I think that i overrode your files because i forgot to change the name in mine ...
I think that i solved the part 1 & 2 of the task ... 
i will update the files with comments (tomorrow because i am really tired now)to help you understand my code.
I uploaded them so you can check everything.
If my code is ok we only have to implement the infinity stack and we are done.
